# Carleton Food Rating
The goal of this project is to develop a website that lists foods available in Carleton College dining halls, let the users rank the food, and display the rankings. We aim to tackle the problem of inconsistent food quality in Burton and LDC and to help students make more informed food choices. We also aim to be more accessible than the Bon Appetit website used by Carleton to display menus & dining hall hours

## Intended features
- Display dining hall status (open or closed)
- Collapsible lists with all food itemsfor each station
- Ratings for each food type and each station
- Easy, accessible way to rate foods
- Accessible design
